# mancala_elo
This program was created using Python to act as a ratings calculator for live Mancala games (For instructions on how to play mancala visit https://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-play-MANCALA/). I have modified the Elo rating system equation to take into account the piece difference at the end of the game. Since there are 48 pieces total, the player's pieces should add up to 48 at the end of the game.
